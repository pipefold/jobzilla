# Claude Code Guidelines for this Project

## Commit Message Style

For small commits (single file changes, minor updates):
- Use simple one-line commit messages
- No bullet points or detailed descriptions
- No "Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By" footers
- Format: `type: brief description`
- Example: `feat: upgrade to Nomic v1.5 model with Docker image caching`

For larger commits (multiple files, significant features):
- Can use more detailed commit messages if needed
- Still keep it concise
